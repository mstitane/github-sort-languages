## Technical specs

A REST microservice based on spring boot. 

## Functional specs

- Develop a REST microservice that list the languages used by the 100 trending public repos on GitHub.
- For every language, you need to calculate the attributes below ðŸ‘‡:
    - Number of repos using this language
    - The list of repos using the language

## How to get Trending Repos from Github

Fetching trending repositories simply translates to fetching the most starred repos created in the last 30 days ( from now ). To do that, you'll need to call the following endpoint:

```
https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=created:>{date}&sort=stars&order=desc
```

The JSON data from Github will be paginated (you'll receive around 100 repos per JSON page). You can ignore the subsequent pages since you only need the first 100 repositories.
